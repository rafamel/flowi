# Flowi

**This package is no longer maintained,** in favor of a more native approach via [*joi-add*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi-add).

Most of what could be done with *Flowi* can now be done by using the [*Joi*](https://github.com/hapijs/joi/) plugin [*joi-add*](https://www.npmjs.com/package/joi-add) and the [`any.concat()`](https://github.com/hapijs/joi/blob/master/API.md#anyconcatschema) API method.

[Here's the previous *Flowi* documentation](https://github.com/rafamel/flowi/blob/master/documentation.md)
